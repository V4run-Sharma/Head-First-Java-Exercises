The coffee machine gave Alex an Americano because the `sorted()` method sorted the coffee names alphabetically, not by their strength. To get the weakest coffee, the sorting should be done based on the coffee's strength:

Optional<String> afternoonCoffee = coffees.stream()
    .sorted(Comparator.comparingInt(Coffee::getStrength))
    .map(Coffee::getName)
    .findFirst();
