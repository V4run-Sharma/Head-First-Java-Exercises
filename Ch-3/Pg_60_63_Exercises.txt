Pg-60:  The current value of pets[2] is "null"
        pets[3] = new Dog();

        NOTE: """Implicit Widening""": You canâ€™t stick a double into an int array (spillage, remember?). You can, however, put a byte into an int array, because a byte will always fit into an int-sized cup. This is known as an implicit widening.

        NOTE: String are a special type of references, you can create and assign them as primitives even though they're references. This is because a string is an array of characters and an array "variable" is always a reference to it's first element.

Pg-63:  Be The Compiler

        A.  Compilation error, myBooks[0], [1], and [2] aren't assigned Books objects and therefore don't have any properties.
        Correction:
            class Books {
                String title;
                String author;
            }
            class BooksTestDrive {
                public static void main(String[] args) {

                    myBooks[0] = new Books();
                    myBooks[1] = new Books();
                    myBooks[2] = new Books();

                    myBooks[0].title = "The Grapes of Java";

                        System.out.print(" by ");
                        System.out.println(myBooks[x].author);

                    }
                }
            }

        B.  Runtime Error: The "h" is of size 3 -> max index = 2, but in the while loop the value of "z" goes upto 3 and references h[3] which doesn't exist and is out of bounds.
        Correction:

                String name;
