By synchronizing access to the shared letters list. By using Collections.synchronizedList, the list operations (like add) are automatically synchronized, preventing race conditions when multiple threads modify the list concurrently. Additionally, in the getLetters() method, wrapping the list access inside a synchronized block ensures that the list is not modified by another thread while it's being read, providing a consistent view of the list's contents.
